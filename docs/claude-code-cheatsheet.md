# Claude Code request cheatsheet

Five commands cover everything. Skills can be chained or run standalone.

**Commands** (invoked as `/project:command-name`):
- `/project:review` — comprehensive review — creates a native agent team with five specialist reviewers (security, performance, Cloud Manager, SonarCloud, maintainability) running in parallel, then consolidates findings
- `/project:create` — any AEM artifact, detects type automatically
- `/project:explain` — component walkthrough or pipeline impact
- `/project:pr` — PR summary with risks and test plan
- `/project:bug` — bug investigation

**Skills** (invoked directly by name):
- `/aem-security` — security-only check
- `/aem-performance` — performance-only check
- `/aem-cloudmanager` — Cloud Manager / OakPAL check
- `/aem-sonar` — SonarCloud quality check
- `/aem-oak-index` — Oak index review or creation
- `/aem-headless` — Content Fragments and GraphQL review

Rules in `.claude/rules/` activate automatically when Claude reads or edits matching files — no action needed.

## Review

### Full review of current branch changes
```
/project:review

---

## Git and diff workflows

### Summarize current changes
```
Summarize the modified files and their purpose in the context of this AEM repository.
```

### Generate a commit message
```
Suggest a concise git commit message for my current staged changes.
```

```

---

## Quality and security

### Null safety and complexity check
```
Review this file for null safety, exception handling, deeply nested logic, and the smallest practical cleanups:
[file path]
```

### Test gap review
```
Review this change and tell me what unit tests or integration tests are missing:
[file or folder path]
```

### Accessibility review

The `accessibility.md` rule activates automatically when editing HTL, dialogs, or frontend files. For an explicit audit of an existing component:

```
Review this component for WCAG 2.1 accessibility issues — HTL aria attributes, dialog field labels, heading structure, and keyboard navigation:
ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/myproject/components/product-card
```

```
Check the dialog for this component for missing fieldLabel, fieldDescription, and any fields that could cause authoring accessibility issues:
ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/myproject/components/product-card/_cq_dialog/.content.xml
```

```
Review this React component for accessible modal behavior — focus trapping, ARIA roles, and keyboard support:
ui.frontend.react/src/components/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx
```

---

### pr-review-toolkit agents (auto-triggered, no command needed)

These agents fire automatically when you ask naturally — no slash command required:

**Silent failure detection**
```
Check if the error handling in [file path] has any silent failures or swallowed exceptions
```

**Test coverage analysis**
```
Review the test coverage for [file path] — are edge cases and null inputs covered?
```

**Comment accuracy**
```
Check if the Javadoc comments in [file path] are accurate and up to date
```

**Type design review**
```
Review the type design of [class name] — are invariants well expressed and encapsulation strong?
```

**Full PR toolkit review**
```
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
```
*(runs all six toolkit agents — complements `/project:review` which focuses on AEM-specific concerns)*

---

## Oak indexes

### Review an existing index
```
/aem-oak-index ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/oak:index/myproject-product-lucene/.content.xml
```

### Create an index for a specific query
```
/aem-oak-index
Create an Oak index for: SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE('/content/mysite') AND [sling:resourceType] = 'myproject/components/product' AND [sku] IS NOT NULL
```

---

## Content Fragments and headless

### Review a CF model or GraphQL query
```
/aem-headless ui.content/src/main/content/jcr_root/conf/mysite/settings/dam/cfm/models/product
```

### Check headless delivery setup
```
/aem-headless
Review our headless setup for persisted query configuration, CORS policy, and Dispatcher filter rules.
```

---

## Dispatcher and configuration

### Review Dispatcher configuration
```
Review this Dispatcher configuration for default-deny filters, sensitive path exposure, cache rules, and Cloud Manager SDK compatibility:
[dispatcher config file path]
```

### Review OSGi configuration
```
Review this OSGi config for correct runmode folder, PID filename, and hardcoded secrets:
[ui.config file path]
```

---

## Exploration and refactoring

### Onboard to an area of the codebase
```
Help me understand this area of the repository, the main files involved, and what to inspect next:
[folder path]
```

### Safe refactoring in an isolated worktree
```
Refactor this Sling Model to extract the query logic into a dedicated OSGi service:
core/src/main/java/com/example/models/ProductModel.java
```
*(Claude delegates to the `aem-refactor` agent — runs in an isolated git worktree so your branch is untouched until you review and merge the changes)*

```
Rename ProductService to CatalogService across core, ui.config, and any HTL references.
```

---

## Bulk operations with /batch

Run the same task across many files in parallel:

### Apply a naming convention fix across all Sling Models
```
/batch
For each file matching core/src/main/java/**/models/**/*.java, check whether the @Model annotation includes defaultInjectionStrategy = DefaultInjectionStrategy.OPTIONAL and add it if missing.
```

### Add missing null checks across all servlets
```
/batch
For each file matching core/src/main/java/**/servlets/**/*.java, check for unguarded resource.adaptTo() calls and add null checks where missing.
```

### Migrate log statements to parameterized format
```
/batch
For each Java file in core/src/main, replace any log statements using string concatenation with SLF4J parameterized format.
```

---

## Polling with /loop

Re-run a check on an interval until a condition is met:

### Poll Cloud Manager pipeline status
```
/loop 5m
Check if the Cloud Manager pipeline at [pipeline URL] has finished. If it has failed, summarize the failure reason. Stop when it reaches succeeded or failed status.
```

### Watch for test failures after a change
```
/loop 2m
Run mvn test -pl core -q and report if any tests fail. Stop after the first clean run.
```

---

## LSP code intelligence (Java and TypeScript)

LSP support is active when `jdtls-lsp` (Java) and `typescript-lsp` (TypeScript) plugins are installed and enabled in `.claude/settings.json`. Claude uses hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics automatically when reading or editing code.

### Test that LSP is active
```
What is the return type of SlingHttpServletRequest.getResource()?
```
*(If LSP is working, Claude uses `lsp_hover` — visible in tool calls. If it falls back to Grep/Read, jdtls is still indexing.)*

### Go to definition
```
Where is ResourceResolverFactory defined and what does the getServiceResourceResolver method signature look like?
```

### Find all usages of a service
```
Find all places where ProductService is injected or used across the codebase.
```

### Check for compile errors before committing
```
Check core/src/main/java/com/example/models/ProductModel.java for any type errors or unresolved references.
```

### Inspect an interface before implementing it
```
Show me the full interface definition for WorkflowProcess so I can implement it correctly.
```

### Review a method signature before calling it
```
What parameters does QueryBuilder.createQuery() accept and what does it return?
```

> **Note:** jdtls indexes the Maven workspace on first run — this takes 3–5 minutes. During indexing, Claude falls back to Grep/Read. Once indexing is complete, `lsp_hover` and `lsp_get_document_symbols` appear in tool calls confirming LSP is active.

---

## Plan mode (read-only exploration before edits)

Enable plan mode before large refactors to let Claude explore without touching any files:

- **CLI**: `claude --permission-mode plan`
- **VS Code**: `Shift+Tab` twice in the chat input to toggle plan/auto mode

### Use case: explore before a large refactor
```
[enter plan mode]
Map all the files I would need to change to rename ProductService to CatalogService across core, ui.config, and any HTL references.
[review the plan, then exit plan mode to execute]
```

### Use case: understand impact before touching a filter
```
[enter plan mode]
What filter roots in ui.content would be affected if I change the filter mode on /content/mysite/us from merge to replace?
```
