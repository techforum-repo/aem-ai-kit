# AEM Claude Code Guidance

> **Part of [aem-ai-kit](../README.md).** These files live under `claude/` in this repository. Install them with `python3 scripts/install.py <aem-project-root> claude` instead of copying by hand. Rules (`.claude/rules/`) and skills (`.claude/skills/`) are generated from the shared `rules/` and `skills/` folders — edit those, then run `python3 scripts/build.py`.

Reusable Claude Code configuration for an enterprise Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS) project. Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS** via the VS Code extension or CLI.

---

## Quick start

**Copy files into your AEM project root:**

```
CLAUDE.md  →  <project-root>/CLAUDE.md
.mcp.json  →  <project-root>/.mcp.json
.claude/   →  <project-root>/.claude/
```

**Then customise for your project:**

1. `CLAUDE.md` — update module names, Maven commands, AEM host/port, and package naming
2. `CLAUDE.md` — update the **Java version** section if your project is not on Java 21 (also update `.claude/rules/core-java.md`)
3. `.claude/settings.json` — set `AEM_HOST`, ports, and any additional Maven profiles to allow
4. `.claude/skills/aem-project-conventions/SKILL.md` — replace `com.example` with your org/project package names; update OSGi config path with your project name — this is the most impactful customisation for code generation quality
5. `.mcp.json` — swap GitHub for Bitbucket if needed (Jira is handled by the `atlassian` plugin — no `.mcp.json` entry needed)
6. Add `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore` for personal permission overrides
7. Optionally commit `.claude/agent-memory/` to share accumulated agent knowledge across the team

**Prerequisites (install once per developer machine):**
- **Python 3** — required for all hooks (`python3 --version` to verify; pre-installed on macOS/Linux; [download for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **jdtls** — Java LSP for real-time diagnostics (see [LSP setup](#lsp-code-intelligence))
- **typescript-language-server** — TypeScript LSP: `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`

## Repository structure

### `CLAUDE.md`
Loaded automatically on every session. Defines module boundaries, AEMaaCS conventions, Cloud Manager safety rules, and build commands.

---

### `.claude/rules/`
Scoped instruction files applied automatically when Claude reads or edits files matching the `paths:` pattern. Multiple rules can apply to the same file — Claude Code merges them, applying the strictest guidance when they overlap.

| File | Paths |
|---|---|
| `core-java.md` | `core/src/main/**/*.java` |
| `core-java-security.md` | `core/src/main/**/*.java` |
| `core-java-performance.md` | `core/src/main/**/*.java` |
| `core-java-tests.md` | `core/src/test/**/*.java` |
| `ui-apps.md` | `ui.apps/**/*.{html,xml,js,css,scss}` |
| `ui-apps-structure.md` | `ui.apps.structure/**/*.xml` |
| `ui-content.md` | `ui.content/**/*.xml` |
| `ui-config.md` | `ui.config/**/*.xml` |
| `all-module.md` | `all/**/*.xml` |
| `frontend-base.md` | `ui.frontend/**/*.{js,ts,css,scss}` |
| `frontend-react.md` | `ui.frontend.react/**/*.{js,ts,css,scss}` |
| `frontend-spa.md` | `ui.frontend.spa/**/*.{js,ts,css,scss}` |
| `dispatcher.md` | `dispatcher/src/**/*.{conf,any,vhost,farm}`, `ui.content/**/etc/map*/**` |
| `oak-index.md` | `ui.apps/**/oak:index/**/*.xml` |
| `content-fragments.md` | `ui.content/**/settings/dam/cfm/**/*.xml`, CF-related Java classes |
| `caconfig.md` | `ui.content/**/sling:configs/**/*.xml`, CAConfig Java interfaces |
| `i18n.md` | `ui.apps/**/i18n/**/*.json`, `ui.apps/**/i18n/**/*.xml` |
| `integration-tests.md` | `it.tests/src/**/*.java`, `ui.tests/src/**/*.java`, `ui.tests/src/**/*.{ts,js}` |
| `accessibility.md` | `ui.apps/**/*.{html,xml}`, `ui.frontend*/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` |
| `wcm-core-components.md` | `ui.apps/**/.content.xml`, `ui.content/**/policies/**`, `ui.content/**/templates/**`, `pom.xml` |

---

### `.claude/commands/`
Five slim entry-point commands. Each routes to the right agents, skills, or creation rules automatically.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/project:review` | Full AEM review — creates a native agent team with six specialist reviewer teammates (security, performance, Cloud Manager, SonarCloud, maintainability, accessibility), each in an isolated context, then consolidates findings |
| `/project:create` | Smart creation — detects artifact type from your description and applies the right rules |
| `/project:explain` | Explains a component end-to-end, or analyses Cloud Manager pipeline impact of current changes |
| `/project:pr` | Drafts a PR summary with modules changed, risks, and test plan. If MCP is unavailable, prompts for ticket description inline rather than silently proceeding without context. |
| `/project:bug` | Investigates a bug by tracing the AEM request path. If MCP is unavailable, prompts for reproduction steps inline. |

#### How to invoke

```
/project:review
```
*(runs `git diff`, creates a native agent team with six specialist reviewers in parallel, merges all findings into one report)*

```
/project:review core/src/main/java/com/example/models/ProductModel.java
```

```
/project:create
A product card component with title, image, price, and CTA. Style system variants for dark/light backgrounds.
```

```
/project:create
Sling Model for the product card at apps/myproject/components/product-card
```

```
/project:explain ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/myproject/components/product-card
```

```
/project:bug
The product card shows a blank title on publish but works on author.
```

### `.claude/skills/`
Focused, reusable skills. Invocable directly by name for quick targeted checks. `/project:review` uses inline `TeamCreate` teammates for parallel review — skills are the lightweight option when you only need one domain checked.

| Skill | Direct invocation | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `aem-security` | `/aem-security` | Admin resolver, query injection, path validation, hardcoded secrets |
| `aem-performance` | `/aem-performance` | Unbounded queries, query-in-loop, `@PostConstruct` overhead, long-lived resolvers |
| `aem-cloudmanager` | `/aem-cloudmanager` | OakPAL violations, embed order, Dispatcher SDK, deployment safety |
| `aem-sonar` | `/aem-sonar` | Complexity, duplication, resource leaks, SonarCloud security hotspots. Uses `model: haiku`. |
| `aem-oak-index` | `/aem-oak-index` | Oak index type, property coverage, `evaluatePathRestrictions`, async config, index creation |
| `aem-headless` | `/aem-headless` | CF model backward compatibility, GraphQL persisted queries, CF Java integration, CORS, Dispatcher rules |
| `aem-accessibility` | `/aem-accessibility` | WCAG 2.1 AA — HTL templates, Coral UI dialogs, React/SPA components, focus management, ARIA usage |
| `aem-project-conventions` | *(not user-invocable — auto-applied)* | Always-loaded team conventions: package naming, Sling Model patterns, HTL conventions, OSGi config placement, test structure |

Run a single skill for a quick focused check before committing:

```
/aem-cloudmanager
```
*(checks current diff for OakPAL and deployment risks only)*

---

### `.claude/agents/`
Custom subagents with their own isolated context window, tool allowlist, and model. Claude delegates to them automatically based on the `description:` field.

| Agent | When Claude uses it |
|---|---|
| `aem-inspector` | Whenever `/project:explain` is called with a component path or class name. Uses `model: opusplan` (Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution) and `memory: project` to accumulate component knowledge across sessions. |
| `aem-refactor` | When asked to refactor, rename, or restructure AEM code. Runs in an isolated git worktree (`isolation: worktree`) — your branch is unchanged until you merge. Uses `memory: project` to remember naming conventions and structural decisions across sessions. |

The six reviewer teammates spawned by `/project:review` are defined as inline prompts inside `review.md` — they run as native `TeamCreate` teammates, not as agent files.

Agents differ from skills: a skill runs inline in your conversation; an agent gets a fresh isolated context, runs to completion, and returns a summary. Use agents for deep multi-file analysis tasks that would otherwise pollute the main conversation with file contents.

### `.claude/hooks/`
Shell scripts executed at Claude Code lifecycle events. Registered in `settings.json` under `"hooks"`.

> **Prerequisite:** All hooks are Python scripts and require **Python 3** on PATH. Verify with `python3 --version`. Python 3 is pre-installed on macOS and most Linux distributions. On Windows, install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is added to PATH during setup.

Included hooks:
- **`guard-sensitive-files.py`** (`PreToolUse` — Write/Edit) — blocks Claude from editing secret files: `.env` files, key and certificate stores (`.key`, `.pem`, `.jks`, `.p12`, `.pfx`, `.keystore`), and config files named for secrets (`credentials.json`, `secrets.yaml`). It matches file names and extensions rather than substrings, so source files such as `PasswordResetServlet.java` stay editable. Extend `SENSITIVE_EXTENSIONS` or `SECRET_NAME` to match your project's naming conventions.

- **`guard-bash-deploy.py`** (`PreToolUse` — Bash) — blocks Maven autoInstall commands targeting non-localhost AEM instances. Prevents Claude from accidentally deploying to shared dev, staging, or production environments. Parses each Maven command in the line (including `&&` chains, `./mvnw`, `-P x` / `-Px` / `--activate-profiles`, and `-Daem.host=x` / `-D aem.host=x`); if `aem.host` or `aem.publish.host` is not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, the command is blocked and echoed back so the developer can run it manually. It also blocks the `deploy` phase and `release:*` goals, which the `settings.json` deny patterns can miss when other goals come first (`mvn clean deploy`).

- **`post-format.py`** (`PostToolUse`) — after Claude writes or edits a Java file in `core/`, automatically runs `mvn spotless:apply -pl core` to keep formatting consistent. Includes a **30-second debounce** — if Claude edits multiple Java files in quick succession, Spotless only runs once per 30-second window instead of once per file. Requires the [Spotless Maven plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) in `core/pom.xml` (see below). If your team uses a different formatter, see [Using a different formatter](#using-a-different-formatter).

- **`post-dispatcher-validate.py`** (`PostToolUse`) — after Claude writes or edits a Dispatcher config file (`.any`, `.conf`, `.rules`, `.vars`, `.farm`, `.vhost` under `conf.dispatcher.d/` or `conf.d/`), automatically runs the [AEM Dispatcher SDK validator](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/dispatcher-tools.html) to catch config errors immediately. Skips gracefully if the SDK validator is not installed.

  **Where to install the validator:**
  Download the AEM SDK zip from [Adobe Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads). Inside you will find `aem-sdk-dispatcher-tools-*-unix.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `aem-sdk-dispatcher-tools-*-windows.zip` (Windows).

  | Platform | Binary name | Expected location |
  |---|---|---|
  | Linux / macOS | `validator` (Go binary, no extension) | `~/aem-sdk/bin/validate` (symlink) |
  | Windows | `validator.exe` or `validate.cmd` | `%USERPROFILE%\aem-sdk\bin\validator.exe` |

  **Linux/macOS one-time setup** (run from the folder where you downloaded the SDK):
  ```bash
  chmod +x aem-sdk-dispatcher-tools-*-unix.sh && ./aem-sdk-dispatcher-tools-*-unix.sh
  mkdir -p ~/aem-sdk/bin
  ln -sf ~/aem-sdk-*/dispatcher-sdk-*/bin/validator ~/aem-sdk/bin/validate
  ```

  **Windows one-time setup:**
  ```powershell
  # Extract aem-sdk-dispatcher-tools-*-windows.zip
  # Copy the contents of dispatcher-sdk-*\bin\ into %USERPROFILE%\aem-sdk\bin\
  # Ensure validator.exe (or validate.cmd) is at %USERPROFILE%\aem-sdk\bin\validator.exe
  ```

  > **Note:** `validator.exe` and `validate.cmd` are Windows-only and will not run on Linux/macOS.

  Keep the SDK outside the project so it is not committed to source control.

#### Setting up Spotless in `core/pom.xml`

Add the following inside `<build><plugins>` in your `core/pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.diffplug.spotless</groupId>
  <artifactId>spotless-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.43.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <java>
      <googleJavaFormat>
        <version>1.19.2</version>
        <!-- GOOGLE = 2-space indent  |  AOSP = 4-space indent (common in enterprise AEM) -->
        <style>GOOGLE</style>
      </googleJavaFormat>
    </java>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
      <phase>verify</phase>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Verify it works before relying on the hook:

```bash
mvn spotless:apply -pl core
mvn spotless:check -pl core
```

The `check` goal is wired to the `verify` phase so Cloud Manager will fail the build if unformatted code is pushed.

#### Using a different formatter

Edit `.claude/hooks/post-format.py` and replace the command list in the `subprocess.run(...)` call:

| Formatter | Command list |
|---|---|
| Spotless (default) | `["mvn", "spotless:apply", "-pl", "core", "-q"]` |
| Eclipse formatter plugin | `["mvn", "formatter:format", "-pl", "core", "-q"]` |
| Checkstyle (check only, no auto-fix) | `["mvn", "checkstyle:check", "-pl", "core", "-q"]` |
| Palantir Java Format via Spotless | Change `<googleJavaFormat>` to `<palantirJavaFormat>` in `pom.xml`, keep same command |
| Custom shell script | `["bash", ".claude/hooks/format-java.sh", file_path]` |

**Spotless with Eclipse formatter plugin (`com.googlecode.maven-java-formatter-plugin`):**

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.googlecode.maven-java-formatter-plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-java-formatter-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.4</version>
  <configuration>
    <configFile>${project.basedir}/../eclipse-formatter.xml</configFile>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

```python
# post-format.py — replace the subprocess.run command list with:
["mvn", "formatter:format", "-pl", "core", "-q"]
```

If your project does not use any auto-formatter, remove the `PostToolUse` hook entry from `.claude/settings.json` — the other two hooks remain active independently.

- **`teammate-idle.py`** (`TeammateIdle`) — fires when a reviewer teammate is about to go idle. Checks if the teammate has produced a findings report: requires both a keyword (Blocking / Warning / Suggestion / Finding / No issues) **and** a minimum of 150 characters, to prevent a one-liner from being mistaken for a complete report. If not, exits with code 2 to keep the teammate working.

- **`subagent-stopped.py`** (`SubagentStop`) — fires when a reviewer teammate stops unexpectedly before completing its report. Prints a visible warning naming the missing domain and exits with code 2 to restart the teammate. Only fires for the six known reviewer teammates — other subagents are ignored.

- **`post-tool-failure.py`** (`PostToolUseFailure`) — logs tool failures with context (command, file path, error) to stderr. Helps diagnose recurring Maven build failures, Spotless errors, or blocked file edits without having to scroll back through the session.

- **`post-stop.py`** (`Stop`) — at the end of every session, prints a reminder to check `git status`, review the diff, and flush any non-obvious learnings to `.claude/agent-memory/` for team sharing.

- **`post-compact.py`** (`PostCompact`) — when a session grows long, Claude Code compresses the conversation history to free up context window space. After compaction, Claude loses the detailed rule context injected earlier in the session. This hook fires immediately after compaction and prints a short set of critical AEM rules back into context.

  The reminder is intentionally minimal — only rules where a single wrong edit causes a **production or security consequence** (admin resolver, resource leak, XSS, OakPAL failure, thread starvation). Style and convention rules are omitted to keep the reinjected context small. To customise, edit the `REMINDER` string in `post-compact.py`.

Supported events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`, and others. See `docs/claude-code-setup.md` for examples.

### `.claude/settings.json`
Permission rules that control which shell commands Claude Code can run automatically vs. which require approval. Uses a three-tier model: `allow` / `ask` / `deny`.

Also sets project-wide environment variables (`AEM_HOST`, `AEM_PORT_AUTHOR`, `AEM_PORT_PUBLISH`) used in build commands. Override in `.claude/settings.local.json` for your local environment.

Adjust the lists to match your team's conventions. The defaults allow common Maven and git read commands, prompt for git write operations, and block destructive or credential-exposing operations.

**Deny list covers:**
- `rm -rf*`, `rd /s *`, `Remove-Item * -Recurse*`, `del /f /s *` — destructive deletions (Unix and Windows)
- `curl *admin:admin*` — default AEM credential exposure
- `mvn deploy*`, `mvn release:*` — artifact publishing
- `git push --force*` — destructive remote rewrite

**Hook CWD note:** All hook commands are prefixed with `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` so they always run from the project root, regardless of which directory Claude navigated to during the session. If you add a custom hook, follow the same pattern:

```json
"command": "cd \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\" && (python3 .claude/hooks/my-hook.py || python .claude/hooks/my-hook.py)"
```

> **Commands vs Skills:** Both are used in this repo and serve different purposes. **Commands** (`.claude/commands/project/`) are orchestration entry points invoked as `/project:<name>` (e.g. `/project:review`) — they coordinate agents and multi-step workflows. **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) are focused, reusable domain tools invoked directly as `/<name>` (e.g. `/aem-security`) and support model overrides and auto-loading via `user-invocable: false`.

### `docs/`

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `docs/claude-code-cheatsheet.md` | Full cheatsheet of freeform and command-based requests by category |
| `docs/claude-code-setup.md` | Setup guide — installation, IDE integration, permissions, MCP, daily workflow |

---

## LSP (Code intelligence)

`jdtls-lsp` and `typescript-lsp` are enabled in `settings.json` as project-scoped plugins. When the language server binaries are on PATH, Claude gains:

- **Real-time diagnostics** — type errors, missing imports, and syntax issues surfaced immediately after every edit
- **Go to definition** — navigate to Sling API, JCR, OSGi, and project class definitions directly
- **Find references** — trace usages of services, models, and interfaces across the codebase
- **Type information** — hover type info for `@Model`, `@Component`, `@Reference` annotations

### Install language server binaries

**Java (jdtls) — required for `core/` module:**

`jdtls` is not available via apt or brew — install it manually (same steps on Linux, macOS, and Windows):

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
# 1. Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jdtls ~/.cache/jdtls/workspace ~/.local/bin

# 2. Download latest milestone from Eclipse
curl -L -o /tmp/jdtls.tar.gz \
  "https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones/1.57.0/jdt-language-server-1.57.0-202602261110.tar.gz"

# 3. Extract
tar -xzf /tmp/jdtls.tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/jdtls

# 4. Symlink the launcher (ships with the package)
ln -sf ~/.local/share/jdtls/bin/jdtls ~/.local/bin/jdtls

# 5. Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

# 6. Verify
which jdtls
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# 1. Create directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\jdtls"

# 2. Download (update URL to latest milestone from https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones/)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones/1.57.0/jdt-language-server-1.57.0-202602261110.tar.gz" `
  -OutFile "$env:TEMP\jdtls.tar.gz"

# 3. Extract (requires tar, available on Windows 10+)
tar -xzf "$env:TEMP\jdtls.tar.gz" -C "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\jdtls"

# 4. Add to PATH — add this to your PowerShell profile or System Environment Variables:
$env:PATH += ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\jdtls\bin"
```

> jdtls ships with a `bin/jdtls` launcher script (Linux/macOS) and `bin/jdtls.bat` (Windows). No wrapper script needed — just add `bin/` to PATH.

> **First-run note:** jdtls indexes the Maven workspace on startup. This takes 3–5 minutes on first launch. CPU will drop to ~0% when indexing is complete. Until then LSP diagnostics will not fire.

**TypeScript — required for `ui.frontend*` modules:**

```bash
# Linux / macOS / Windows (via npm)
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript
```

### Enable LSP tools

`settings.json` already includes `"ENABLE_LSP_TOOL": "1"` in the `env` block — this is required to activate the LSP tool calls in Claude. No manual change needed if you copied `settings.json` from this repo.

### Install the plugins

Four plugins are pre-enabled in `settings.json`. On first session Claude Code will prompt you to install them, or install manually inside a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin install jdtls-lsp@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official
/plugin install atlassian@claude-plugins-official
```

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jdtls-lsp` | Java LSP — real-time diagnostics, go-to-definition, type info for `core/` |
| `typescript-lsp` | TypeScript LSP — diagnostics and navigation for `ui.frontend*` modules |
| `pr-review-toolkit` | General PR review agents — comment accuracy, test coverage, silent failures, type design |
| `atlassian` | Jira + Confluence MCP — `/project:bug` and `/project:pr` fetch ticket context automatically |

> If your team does not use Jira/Confluence, remove `atlassian` from `enabledPlugins` in `settings.json`.

#### Configuring the Atlassian plugin

Each developer connects with their own credentials via `.claude/settings.local.json` (git-ignored — never commit credentials):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "JIRA_URL": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
    "JIRA_USERNAME": "your-email@company.com",
    "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
  }
}
```

Generate an API token at [id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens). Supports Jira Cloud, Server, and Data Center (requires standard REST API access).

**How it is used:**

```
/project:pr PROJ-1234
```
Fetches the ticket requirements and aligns the PR summary with acceptance criteria.

```
/project:bug PROJ-5678
Product card shows blank title on publish but works on author.
```
Fetches reproduction steps and comments from the ticket before starting the investigation.

Restart the Claude Code session after installing — no `/reload-plugins` needed when starting fresh. Check `/plugin` → **Errors** tab if a language server binary is not found on PATH.

### Verify LSP is active

Ask Claude a question about a project-specific method:
```
What is the return type of ProductCardImpl.getCtaLink()?
```
- **LSP active** — Claude uses `lsp_hover` or `lsp_definition` tool calls
- **LSP not active** — Claude falls back to `Search` (grep)

---

## MCP servers

`.mcp.json` at the repository root is loaded automatically for all team members. Configure it to match your team's source control and issue tracker.

`/project:pr` and `/project:bug` use whichever MCP is configured — pass a Jira ticket, GitHub issue, or Bitbucket issue reference as an argument and Claude fetches the full context automatically. Without a reference, both commands fall back to git only.

### Source control — pick one

**GitHub** (default in `.mcp.json`; GitHub's official remote server, nothing to install):
```json
"github": {
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
}
```

**Bitbucket:**
```json
"bitbucket": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-bitbucket"],
  "env": {
    "BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "${BITBUCKET_USERNAME}",
    "BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD": "${BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD}"
  }
}
```

### Issue tracker — Jira (recommended for AEM enterprise teams)

Jira is handled by the `atlassian@claude-plugins-official` plugin — no `.mcp.json` entry needed. See [Configuring the Atlassian plugin](#configuring-the-atlassian-plugin) for credential setup.

Once configured, `/project:pr PROJ-123` fetches ticket requirements and aligns the PR summary with acceptance criteria. `/project:bug PROJ-456` fetches reproduction steps and comments before starting the investigation.

### Other useful MCP servers

| Server | Use case |
|---|---|
| Fetch | Pull live AEM Javadocs, Sling API docs, or external specs into context |
| Custom AEM MCP | Query CRXDE, Felix console, or AEM APIs directly |

Add personal-only MCP servers (with credentials) using local scope — not committed to git:
```bash
claude mcp add --scope local my-server -- npx -y some-mcp-package
```

## Implemented Claude Code features

| Feature | Where used |
|---|---|
| **`model: opusplan`** | `aem-inspector` agent — Opus reasons about cross-module structure, Sonnet executes the analysis |
| **`model: haiku`** | `aem-sonar` skill — mechanical checklist checks don't need a heavyweight model |
| **`model: sonnet`** | `aem-refactor` agent — balanced model for reading, writing, and reasoning about code changes |
| **`isolation: worktree`** | `aem-refactor` agent — refactoring runs in an isolated git copy, branch is safe until merged |
| **`memory: project`** | `aem-inspector` agent — accumulates component knowledge across sessions in `.claude/agent-memory/` |
| **`user-invocable: false`** | `aem-project-conventions` skill — always-loaded team conventions applied silently on every task |
| **Agent teams** | `review.md` uses `TeamCreate` to spawn 6 native reviewer teammates in parallel (security, performance, Cloud Manager, SonarCloud, maintainability, accessibility), each with its own isolated context, then merges findings |
| **`/batch`** | Documented in cheatsheet — bulk convention fixes, null-check additions, log statement migrations |
| **`/loop`** | Documented in cheatsheet — Cloud Manager pipeline polling, test failure watching |
| **Plan mode** | Documented in cheatsheet — read-only exploration before large refactors or filter changes |

## Extending this repository

**Design principles:** broad standards belong in `CLAUDE.md`; module-specific guidance belongs in `.claude/rules/` with `paths:` scoping; commands in `.claude/commands/` should route and orchestrate, not duplicate rule content; skills in `.claude/skills/` stay focused and reusable; `settings.json` reflects your team's trust boundaries.


### Add a scoped rule
Create `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` with `paths:` frontmatter. Claude applies it automatically when matching files are read or edited. No registration needed.

```markdown
---
description: Rules for custom base components
paths:
  - "ui.apps/**/components/base/**/*.html"
  - "ui.apps/**/components/base/**/*.xml"
---
# Base component rules
...
```

### Add a custom agent
Create `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`. Claude delegates to it automatically when the task matches the `description:` field. Use agents for deep multi-file tasks that would otherwise flood the main context.

```markdown
---
name: aem-accessibility-auditor
description: Use when asked to audit AEM components for WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
---

Audit the component at $ARGUMENTS for accessibility:
- HTL aria attributes and landmark roles
- Dialog field labels and descriptions
- Color contrast in component styles
- Keyboard navigation support

### Add a new skill
Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The skill is immediately invocable as `/<skill-name>` for targeted checks. To include it in full reviews, add a new teammate block to `review.md` with the relevant prompt.

```markdown
---
name: aem-accessibility
description: AEM accessibility review — WCAG 2.1, HTL aria attributes, dialog labels
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
argument-hint: "[file or component path]"
---
Review `$ARGUMENTS` for accessibility issues...
```

### Extend the /create command
Add a row to the routing table in `create.md` to handle new artifact types.

### Add a hook
Write a Python script in `.claude/hooks/`. Register it in `.claude/settings.json`. Always prefix the command with `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" &&` so the hook runs from the project root even if Claude has changed directories during the session:

```json
"PostToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "Write|Edit",
    "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cd \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\" && (python3 .claude/hooks/my-hook.py || python .claude/hooks/my-hook.py)" }]
  }
]
```

### Add MCP servers (team-shared)
Create `.mcp.json` at the repository root. All team members pick it up automatically.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Future enhancements

Ideas and opportunities not yet implemented — ready to pick up:

### MCP servers
- **AEM MCP server (Adobe)** — Enabling the official Adobe MCP server for AEM that would let Claude query the JCR, inspect content structures, and trigger replication directly from the conversation.
- **Cloud Manager MCP server (Adobe)** — Enabling the official Cloud Manager MCP server would let Claude check pipeline status, read environment logs, and inspect deployment history without leaving the conversation. Pairs naturally with the `/project:pr` command and `/loop` polling pattern.

### Custom plugins
- **`aem-sdk` plugin** — a custom Claude Code plugin that wraps AEM SDK tools as MCP tools, allowing Claude to invoke them directly from the conversation without shell hooks. Would cover: Dispatcher SDK validator, Oak run jar commands (compaction, check, explore), Content Package Manager API, and Felix console queries. Use `plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official` as a starting point.

### Broader
- Refine commands based on real team usage patterns
- Add project-specific rules for custom base components or internal utility libraries
- Expand `settings.json` with additional safe Maven profiles for your project
